# Getting Started

## Setup

While not strictly necessary, it is strongly recommended to download and setup [Jetbrains Writerside](https://www.jetbrains.com/writerside/).

> This is the primary tool we use for maintaining these docs and displays a correct preview of what the docs will look like in production.

Authors may also opt to use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or any similar text editor, though the pages will not be rendered correctly in a standard markdown previewer.
