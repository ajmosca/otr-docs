# o!TR Processor

The [o!TR Processor](https://github.com/osu-tournament-rating/otr-processor) is a [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) program that serves two purposes:

1. Processes all match data from the [o!TR API](o-TR-API.md) for:
    * Leaderboard recalculation
    * Rating calculation
    * Host of the algorithm by which ratings are affected
2. (Coming soon) Host a private processing API to be used by the [o!TR API](o-TR-API.md):
    * Allows internal clients to have access to model functions, such as match predictions.
