# Terms of Use

By using the o!TR API, you agree to abide by these terms of use. The o!TR API is provided publicly, for free, for all users by the osu! Tournament Rating Team ("o!TR Team", "us", "our").

## Scraping

The API must not be used to scrape information. Scraping data, such as tournaments, matches, etc. is forbidden and will result in a permanent revocation of API access. Please see the [data](Data.md) page for more information on conveniently importing our dataset.

## Accreditation

Data which is sourced from us should be credited properly. Misleading users to believe data created by us is provided by another source, or failing to credit this information as being created by us, is not allowed.

> For example, informing users of your application that information is provided by osu! officially is not allowed because it is not true.
